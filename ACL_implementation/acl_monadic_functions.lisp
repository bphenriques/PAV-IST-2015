;Creates a tensor whose elements are the symmetric of the corresponding elements of the argument tensor.
(defun .- ())

;Same as the previous one, but using the inverse.
(defun ./ ())

;Same as the previous one, but using the factorial.
(defun .! ())

;Same as the previous one, but using the sin function
(defun .sin ()) 

;Same as the previous one, but using the cos function.
(defun .cos (
